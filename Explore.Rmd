# Boston Housing Data

```{python}
# Import libraries required
import pandas as pd
import numpy as np
import matplotlib.pyplot as plt
from sklearn import datasets, linear_model
from sklearn.model_selection import train_test_split
from sklearn.metrics import (r2_score, mean_squared_error)
```

```{python}
# Import data from CSV
df = pd.read_csv("housing.csv")
```

```{python}
# Initial view of data
df.head()

# RM is average number of rooms in local area
# LSTAT is percentage of lower income homeowners
# PTRatio ratio of students to teachers in local schools
# MDEV (output) is the median house value in the local area
```

## Visualisation

```{python}
# Plot showing relationship between # of rooms to median house value
df.plot(x ='RM', y='MEDV', kind = 'scatter')
plt.show()
```

```{python}
# Plot showing relationship between % of lower income houseowners to median house value
df.plot(x ='LSTAT', y='MEDV', kind = 'scatter')
plt.show()
```

```{python}
# Plot showing relationship between ratio of teachers to students to median house value
df.plot(x ='PTRATIO', y='MEDV', kind = 'scatter')
plt.show()
```

# Splitting the data

```{python}
# Output variable
y = df['MEDV'];

# Input variables
x = df.drop('MEDV',axis=1)
```

```{python}
# Splitting the data into train (80%) and test (20%) buckets
x_train, test_df, y_train, y_test = train_test_split(x, y, test_size = 0.2)
```

```{python}
# Splitting the train data into train (80%) and cross validation (20%) buckets - currently not using CV
train_df, cv_df, y_train, y_cv = train_test_split(x_train, y_train, test_size=0.2)
```

# Fitting a model

```{python}
# Linear regression model - creating object instance
lm = linear_model.LinearRegression()

# Training model with training data
lm.fit(train_df, y_train)

# Generating predictions of test data
predictions = lm.predict(test_df)
```

# Evaluate results

```{python}
# Calculate R2 score - measure effectiveness of model
r2_score(y_test, predictions)
```

```{python}
# Plot showing true values vs. predictions - perfect model would give a straight line of gradient 1
plt.scatter(y_test, predictions)
plt.xlabel("True Values")
plt.ylabel("Predictions")
```
