# Boston Housing


The aim of this exercise is to predict the median house values (MEDV) of different areas in Boston. The data available to us is the following:

- 'RM' is the average number of rooms among homes in the neighborhood.
- 'LSTAT' is the percentage of homeowners in the neighborhood considered "lower class" (working poor).
- 'PTRATIO' is the ratio of students to teachers in primary and secondary schools in the neighborhood.


The raw data can be found in housing.csv and the code can be found in main.ipynb
